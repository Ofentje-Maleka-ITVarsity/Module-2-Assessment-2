                        <h2>Ambulance</h2>
                        Over one day across the streets of L.A., 
                        three lives will change forever. Decorated 
                        veteran Will Sharp, desperate for money to 
                        cover his wifeʼs medical bills, asks for 
                        help from the one person he knows he 
                        shouldnʼt—his adoptive brother, Danny. A 
                        charismatic career criminal, Danny instead 
                        offers him a score: the biggest bank heist 
                        in Los Angeles history – $32 million. With 
                        his wifeʼs survival on the line, Will canʼt 
                        say no. When their getaway goes spectacularly 
                        wrong, the desperate brothers hijack an ambulance 
                        with a wounded cop clinging to life and ace EMT Cam 
                        Thompson on board. In a high-speed pursuit, Will 
                        and Danny must evade a massive, city-wide law enforcement
                         response, keep their hostages alive, and somehow try not 
                         to kill each other, all while executing the most insane 
                         escape L.A. has ever seen.
