                        <h2>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</h2>
                        Creatively unfulfilled and facing financial ruin, 
                        Nicolas Cage must accept a $1-million offer to attend 
                        the birthday of a dangerous superfan. Things take a 
                        wildly unexpected turn when Cage is recruited by a 
                        CIA operative and forced to live up to his own legend, 
                        channeling his most iconic and beloved on-screen characters 
                        in order to save himself and his loved ones. With a career built for this very moment, 
                        the seminal award-winning actor must take on the role of a lifetime: Nicolas Cage.
